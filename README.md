This work, starts from the pipeline of GEN3C paper from Nvidia, and wants to include in this pipeline the possibility to insert and object in it, of which you have a 3D representation (Point Cloud for now, Meshes later).
In particular inserting the object in a video being generated from a single background image
There are 2 possibilities to do that:
- fused 
- full 

To be able to run the code:
- install everything about GEN3C base model following the instruction below
- install missing libraris (don't have a list for now, they are imported in renderingCache.py and renderingCache.py2 files)

The pipeline for now works by:
- using exportPointCloud to export the file
- modify the exported pointCloud in Blender, inserting the object (need to have a PointCloud of the object) where you prefer
- exporting the Shoe alone and the full environment from blender and save them in the correct directory 
- run renderingCache.py or renderingCache2.py depending on the method you want to use (2 runs, the first one you just need to obtain the rendering as initial image (ShoeRendering.png), when you have the file you can just re-run again and complete the run, since I haven't yet canged the original class, where thay want the path and not the image values)

The idea for later is to change the steps in order to have a clean pipeline 


INPUT AND OUTPUTS SHOULD STAY THE SAME IN THE PIPELINE BUT NEED TO CHANGE: 
- create  a class for the cache with the new rendering methods and data attributes
- change renderCache2, the way things  are done is okei, but it is done some useless stuff in the way (so need to create new functions)

Abstract: We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and
temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos,
but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies,
such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented
at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural
network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast,
GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the
pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating
the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with
the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that
GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to
infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus
all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing
the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera
control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view
novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and
monocular dynamic video. Results are best viewed in videos.

## Installation
Please follow the "Inference" section in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to set up your environment.

## Inference

### Download checkpoints
1. Generate a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) access token (if you haven't done so already). Set the access token to `Read` permission (default is `Fine-grained`).

2. Log in to Hugging Face with the access token:
   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login
   ```

3. Download the GEN3C model weights from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/GEN3C-Cosmos-7B):
   ```bash
   CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python scripts/download_gen3c_checkpoints.py --checkpoint_dir checkpoints
   ```

### Interactive GUI usage

<div align="center">
  <img src="gui/assets/gui_preview.webp" alt="GEN3C interactive GUI"  width="1080px"/>
</div>

GEN3C can be used through an interactive GUI, allowing to visualize the inputs in 3D, author arbitrary camera trajectories, and start inference from a single window.
Please see the [dedicated instructions](gui/README.md).


### Command-line usage
GEN3C supports both images and videos as input. Below are examples of running GEN3C on single images and videos with predefined camera trajectory patterns.

### Example 1: Single Image to Video Generation

#### Single GPU
Generate a 121-frame video from a single image:
```bash
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python cosmos_predict1/diffusion/inference/gen3c_single_image.py \
    --checkpoint_dir checkpoints \
    --input_image_path assets/diffusion/000000.png \
    --video_save_name test_single_image \
    --guidance 1 \
    --foreground_masking
```

#### Multi-GPU (8 GPUs)
```bash
NUM_GPUS=8
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) torchrun --nproc_per_node=${NUM_GPUS} cosmos_predict1/diffusion/inference/gen3c_single_image.py \
    --checkpoint_dir checkpoints \
    --input_image_path assets/diffusion/000000.png \
    --video_save_name test_single_image_multigpu \
    --num_gpus ${NUM_GPUS} \
    --guidance 1 \
    --foreground_masking
```

#### Additional Options
- To generate longer videos autoregressively, specify the number of frames using `--num_video_frames`. The number of frames must follow the pattern: 121 * N - 1 (e.g., 241, 361, etc.)
- To save buffer images alongside the output video, add the `--save_buffer` flag
- You can control camera trajectories using `--trajectory`, `--camera_rotation`, and `--movement_distance` arguments. See the "Camera Movement Options" section below for details.

#### Camera Movement Options

##### Trajectory Types
The `--trajectory` argument controls the path the camera takes during video generation. Available options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `left` | Camera moves to the left (default) |
| `right` | Camera moves to the right |
| `up` | Camera moves upward |
| `down` | Camera moves downward |
| `zoom_in` | Camera moves closer to the scene |
| `zoom_out` | Camera moves away from the scene |
| `clockwise` | Camera moves in a clockwise circular path |
| `counterclockwise` | Camera moves in a counterclockwise circular path |

##### Camera Rotation Modes
The `--camera_rotation` argument controls how the camera rotates during movement. Available options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `center_facing` | Camera always rotates to look at the (estimated) center of the scene (default) |
| `no_rotation` | Camera maintains its original orientation while moving |
| `trajectory_aligned` | Camera rotates to align with the direction of movement |

##### Movement Distance
The `--movement_distance` argument controls how far the camera moves from its initial position. The default value is 0.3. A larger value will result in more dramatic camera movement, while a smaller value will create more subtle movement.

##### GPU Memory Requirements

We have tested GEN3C only on H100 and A100 GPUs. For GPUs with limited memory, you can fully offload all models by appending the following flags to your command:

```bash
--offload_diffusion_transformer \
--offload_tokenizer \
--offload_text_encoder_model \
--offload_prompt_upsampler \
--offload_guardrail_models \
--disable_guardrail \
--disable_prompt_encoder
```
Maximum observed memory during inference with full offloading: ~43GB. Note: Memory usage may vary depending on system specifications and is provided for reference only.


### Example 2: Video to Video Generation
For video input, GEN3C requires additional depth information, camera intrinsics, and extrinsics. These can be obtained using your choice of SLAM packages. For testing purposes, we provide example data.

First, you need to download the test samples:
```bash
# Download test samples from Hugging Face
huggingface-cli download nvidia/GEN3C-Testing-Example --repo-type dataset --local-dir assets/diffusion/dynamic_video_samples
```

#### Single GPU
```bash
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python cosmos_predict1/diffusion/inference/gen3c_dynamic.py \
    --checkpoint_dir checkpoints \
    --input_image_path assets/diffusion/dynamic_video_samples/batch_0000 \
    --video_save_name test_dynamic_video \
    --guidance 1
```

#### Multi-GPU (8 GPUs)
```bash
NUM_GPUS=8
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) torchrun --nproc_per_node=${NUM_GPUS} cosmos_predict1/diffusion/inference/gen3c_dynamic.py \
    --checkpoint_dir checkpoints \
    --input_image_path assets/diffusion/dynamic_video_samples/batch_0000 \
    --video_save_name test_dynamic_video_multigpu \
    --num_gpus ${NUM_GPUS} \
    --guidance 1
```
